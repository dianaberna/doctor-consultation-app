# Mobile UI App

## Doctor Consultation App

The goal of this project is to recreate the UI made in Figma using flexbox and adding animations / transitions.
The following are the requirements to be met:
* Respect exactly the provided layout
* If visiting the page on a Desktop, show an alert to the user that says to check the same page from a Mobile Device
* Provide the Mobile experience of Scrolling and Navigation of Details

* Details of the Doctors are mocked (e.g. No API is needed)
* The search input should filter the doctors by name
* Each Category should filter the doctors
* By clicking on a Doctor name, the user should see the details

* Test the layout on a real mobile device (check Browsersync for this)
* Deploy the project towards Netlify (www.netlify.com) connected to your GitHub Repo
* After the project is deployed, analyze it with https://web.dev

## Estimates of execution times
* Recreate the static layout (2h) (index and getstarted page)
* Upload doctors data with js
* Add animations and links (1h)
* Add alert for desktop (30m)
* Realize the search function doctor (30m)
* Analyze and test the proper functioning of the app (1h)
